# Introduction

This little program aims to display markdown files that are on your hard disk. 

Later, I will add supports for some cloud services like Google drive and Dropbox.

This program uses [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) as backend.

# Using the sources

Some pre-requisites : 

   - node-webkit ( v0.9.2 )
   - nodejs ( v0.10.28 )
   - npm global modules
      - bower
      - jsdoc
      - grunt-cli

I assume that you have all the above pre-requisites installed and configured on your environnement.

so, now install all dependencies with the following command :

    npm install
